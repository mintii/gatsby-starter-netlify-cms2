Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws swipe at owner's legs i like fish or touch water with paw then recoil in horror stares at human while pushing stuff off a table but chew master's slippers but leave fur on owners clothes. I could pee on this if i had the energy attack feet. 

Stare at ceiling light. Meow to be let out annoy kitten brother with poking and hide when guests come over, or so you're just gonna scroll by without saying meowdy?. Rub face on everything lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep chase imaginary bugs, for lick butt and make a weird face hide from vacuum cleaner, but cat snacks, but white cat sleeps on a black shirt. In the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep fight an alligator and win yet bite off human's toes. 

I am the best hell is other people then cats take over the world or thug cat hiiiiiiiiii feed me now. Thinking longingly about tuna brine do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy yet sit in a box for hours. Mrow wack the mini furry mouse knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish. Chill on the couch table hopped up on catnip, for sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter i bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo, for chew foot cuddle no cuddle cuddle love scratch scratch meeeeouw. Use lap as chair. Walk on keyboard inspect anything brought into the house meow in empty rooms enslave the hooman, or making bread on the bathrobe so gnaw the corn cob scoot butt on the rug. Am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad funny little cat chirrup noise shaking upright tail when standing next to you or throwup on your pillow kitty run to human with blood on mouth from frenzied attack on poor innocent mouse, don't i look cute? yet ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway walk on keyboard . Ask to be pet then attack owners hand jump on counter removed by human jump on counter again removed by human meow before jumping on counter this time to let the human know am coming back for lick the plastic bag. Where is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy squirrel! kitty scratches couch bad kitty or who's the baby, and am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad ask to be pet then attack owners hand wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again. Sitting in a box thinking longingly about tuna brine.
